  DHCPv4 static mapping https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/services/dhcp/ipv4.html#static-mappings. Static mappings express a preference for which IP address will be assigned to a given client based on its MAC address. In a network where unknown clients are denied, this also serves as a list of known clients which are allowed to receive leases or have static ARP entries.

# pfsense_dhcpv4_staticmapping (Resource)

DHCPv4 [static mapping](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/services/dhcp/ipv4.html#static-mappings). Static mappings express a preference for which IP address will be assigned to a given client based on its MAC address. In a network where unknown clients are denied, this also serves as a list of known clients which are allowed to receive leases or have static ARP entries.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# simple
resource "pfsense_dhcpv4_staticmapping" "example" {
  interface   = "lan"
  mac_address = "00:00:00:00:00:00"
  ip_address  = "192.168.1.10"
}

# advanced
resource "pfsense_dhcpv4_staticmapping" "advanced_example" {
  interface              = "lan"
  mac_address            = "00:00:00:00:00:00"
  client_identifier      = "server-a"
  ip_address             = "192.168.1.10"
  arp_table_static_entry = false
  hostname               = "server-a"
  description            = "server A"
  wins_servers           = ["192.168.1.2"]
  dns_servers            = ["1.1.1.1"]
  gateway                = "192.168.2.1"
  domain_name            = "example.com"
  domain_search_list     = ["example.internal"]
  default_lease_time     = "1h"
  maximum_lease_time     = "12h"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) Network interface. Each interface has its own separate DHCP configuration (including static mappings).
- `mac_address` (String) MAC address of the client to match.

### Optional

- `apply` (Boolean) Apply change, defaults to `true`.
- `arp_table_static_entry` (Boolean) Create an ARP Table Static Entry for this MAC & IP Address pair., defaults to `false`.
- `client_identifier` (String) Identifier to match based on the value sent by the client (RFC 2132).
- `default_lease_time` (String) Default lease time for clients that do not ask for a specific lease expiration time.
- `description` (String) For administrative reference (not parsed).
- `dns_servers` (List of String) DNS (Domain Name System) servers provided to the client.
- `domain_name` (String) Domain name passed to the client to form its fully qualified hostname.
- `domain_search_list` (List of String) DNS search domains that are provided to the client.
- `gateway` (String) IPv4 gateway address.
- `hostname` (String) Name of the host, without the domain part.
- `ip_address` (String) IPv4 address to assign this client. Address must be outside of any defined pools. If no IPv4 address is given, one will be dynamically allocated from a pool.
- `maximum_lease_time` (String) Maximum lease time for clients that ask for a specific lease expiration time.
- `wins_servers` (List of String) WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) servers provided to the client.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# specify in format 'interface,mac_address'
terraform import pfsense_dhcpv4_staticmapping.example lan,00:00:00:00:00:00
```
